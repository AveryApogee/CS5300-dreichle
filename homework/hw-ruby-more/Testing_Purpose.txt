The Purpose of Testing


Part 1: Fun with Strings
Palindrome Detection:
The purpose of the test "it should work for simple strings" is to verify that my algorithm sucessfully distinguishes palindromes from other strings.
The purpose of the test "it should be case-insensitive" is to verify that my algorithm will classify palindromes despite the occurence of capital characters.
The purpose of the test "it should ignore nonword charaters" is to verify that my algorithm will classify palindromes despite the occurence of special characters.
The purpose of the test "it should consider the blank string to be a palindrome" (which is a test I wrote) is to verify that my algorithm will understand the blank string is a palindrome.
The purpose of the test "it should consider a single character to be a palindrome" (which is a test I wrote) is to verify that my algorithm will understand a single character is a palindrome.

Word Count:
The purpose of the test "it should return a hash" is to verify that the format of my algorithm's output is correct.
The purpose of the test "it works on simple strings" is to verify that my algorithm recognizes which words are the same despite capital characters.
The purpose of the test "it ignores punctuation" is to verify that my algorithm will count words sucessfully despite punctuation being attached to some words.
The purpose of the test "it works on the empty string" is to verify that my algorithm will not throw a runtime error when it tries to count nothing.
The purpose of the test "it ignores leading whitespace" is to verify that my algorithm will count words sucessfully despite spaces proceeding some words.
The purpose of the test "it ignores embedded whitespace" is to verify that my algorithm will count words sucessfully despite spaces, newlines, and tabs following some words.

Anagram Grouping:
The purpose of the test "it should work on the empty string" is to verify that my algorithm will not throw a runtime error when it tries to check if nothing has an anagram grouping.
The purpose of the test "it should return an array of arrays for nonempty string" is to verify that my algorithm will return a data structure in the proper format when fed a non-empty input string.
The purpose of the test "it for scream cars for four scar creams" it to verify that the anagram groups are classified successfully when a string of words is fed as input to my algorithm.
